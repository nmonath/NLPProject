FrameNet II: Extended Theory and Practice 
Josef Ruppenhofer Michael Ellsworth Miriam R. L. Petruck Christopher R. Johnson Jan Scheffczyk 


The Berkeley FrameNet pro ject is creating an on-line lexical resource for English, based on frame semantics and supported by corpus evidence. The aim is to document the range of semantic and syntactic combinatory possibilities– valences–of each word in each of its senses, through computer-assisted annotation of example sentences and automatic tabulation and display of the annotation results. The major product of this work, the FrameNet lexical database, currently contains more than 10,000 lexical units (defined below), more than 6,000 of which are fully annotated, in nearly 800 hierarchically-related semantic frames, exempliﬁed in more than 135,000 annotated sentences. Beginning with Release 1.3, the quality of FrameNet data is monitored by a consistency management system. The database has gone through three releases, and is now in use by hundreds of researchers, teachers, and students around the world. (See the FrameNet Users page on our web-site). Active research projects are seeking to produce comparable frame-semantic lexicons for other languages and to devise means of automatically labeling running text with semantic frame information
