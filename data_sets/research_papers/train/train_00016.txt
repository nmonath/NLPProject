Combinatory Grammar and Projection from the Lexicon 
ANNA SZABOLCSI 


This paper addresses the relation between the lexicon and syntax, and suggests that projection from the lexicon should be the constitutive principle of grammar. The argument will consist of a general part in Section 1 and a specific part in Section 2. In Section 1, I will ask to what extent the assumptions concerning the nature of lexical items determine the form of syntactic representations in various theories. As an illustration, I will briefly examine the treatments of unbounded dependencies in Government and Binding theory, Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar, and Combinatory Categorial Grammar. I will argue that the concept of lexical items as functions underlies all three of them. However, only CCG recognizes this within its theoretical frames, and therefore only CCG can use it as an explanatory principle. In Section 2, I present a case study on anaphora as a specific example of the connection between the lexicon and syntax within this theory. I will show that a simple lexical distinction between duplicators and free variables interacts with the independently motivated machinery of CCG to derive what is commonly stipulated in Binding Theory in syntax. Section 2.1 will be concerned with reflexives, and Section 2.2 with pronouns. After showing that the combinatory approach inescapably leads to a theory a la Reinhart, in Section 2.3 I will extend the proposal to VP-ellipsis, and eliminate an apparent problem caused by strict readings with non-referential antecedents.
